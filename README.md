# ACR

[For Dr. Ron]

Identifying the five most probable ACR classes (out of 345) for 18,000+ clinical diagnoses.
Used bag-of-words representation for the diagnoses and a random forest classifier to obtain the class probabilities. A support vector machine model might have been better but I need to read more on it for fine-tuning because it took too much memory to run.
